# Machine Learning Coursera: Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

1. In the first half of this exercise, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 
2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use 
a Gaussian kernel with SVMs.
2. In the next half of the exercise, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.
